# Michigan Dining: Alexa Skill to Retrieve Menus

## About
This is a skill for Amazon Alexa that allows you to ask for menus for the dining hall locations at the University of Michigan. The data is gathered by scraping the Michigan Dining website as it gets updated each day and stored in a Cloud Firestore database.

### Supported Actions

- Ask for the meal at a specific dining hall
- Ask for the meal at a specific station within a dining hall

### Example Commands
Ask Michigan Dining...
- What's for (lunch) at (Mojo) today?
- What's the menu at (South Quad)?
- What's for (dinner)?
- What will I find at (Markley)?
- What's for (dinner) at (the Grill) in (Mojo)?
- What's (Homestyles) serving for (dinner) at (Oxford)?

Instead of providing the exact verbiage here for each command, I strive to make the experience as natural as I can. Simply try asking for what you want in a way that feels _right_ to you.  If a particular phrase doesn't work and you think it should, file an issue and I'll see what I can do to accommodate the phrase you prefer.
